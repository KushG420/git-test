# Browse Abandonment

## Current Improvements
- **Timing**: Quite aggressive, currently being sent 2 hours after trigger, and 24 hours after the first mail, almost identical to the checkout abandonment flow.
- **Subject Lines**: Identical to checkout abandonment.
- **Email Timing Adjustment**: Consider timing these emails around the same time of day as the original browsing session of a particular user, if possible.
- **Email Design**: The last email design is a bit weird and does not match with other emails, although this could be incorrect.

## Long-term Improvements for Browse Abandonment
- **Email Quantity**: At least 10 emails spread over 21 days.
- **Custom Flows For**:
  - Best seller products.
  - Customer viewing a particular product multiple times.
  - Reusing top performing content from other flows.
  - Progressively higher discounts.

# Checkout Abandonment

- **First Email Message**: Current message more suited for browse abandonment. Suggested: "Elegant choices, [Name]! Your skincare collection awaits completion. Return to your cart and indulge in the luxury your skin deserves."
- **Second Email Subject Line**: Should be a welcome gift or similar, not generic. Suggested: "We don't do this often."
- **New Customer Flow**: For the final mail, currently sent after 4 days from when the checkout started, versus within 48 hours in the old flow.
- **Subscription/Reminder Flow**: Are we adding people who aren't able to complete checkout into this flow?
- **Dynamic Discount Expiry**: Consider adding expiry of ongoing discounts dynamically, like the current New Year sale.
- **Missing Key Selling Points**: Ongoing New Year sales, free shipping, returns.
- **Free Shipping Title**: For orders greater than 45gbp in the UK, title the email with free shipping.
- **Dynamic Content**: Consider adding stock levels or items running out dynamically.
- **Product Recommendations**: Similar product recommendations that pair well are missing.
- **Customer Reviews**: The section is missing, and if possible, categorically show the reviews.
- **Email Sequence**:
  - First to remind.
  - Second to urge action (perhaps with added urgency or social proof).
  - Third to offer an incentive like a discount or free shipping.
  - Currently, the first is a reminder, the second is also a reminder, and the third is an urgency that the cart is expiring.
- **Timer in Cart Expiration Mail**: Look to add.
- **Feedback**: Include asking for feedback in the final mail.
